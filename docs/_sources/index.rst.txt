Welcome to CRCDiagram's documentation!
======================================

CRCDiagram is a generator of Class Responsibility Collaboration diagrams in python (more languages will be available soon)
using `DOT language`_.

------------
What is CRC?
------------

A Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) is a collection of standard index cards that have been divided into three sections.

| A class represents a collection of similar objects, a responsibility is something that a class knows or does,
 and a collaborator is another class that a class interacts with to fulfill its responsibilities.

How it works
------------

Suppose that you have a project with two classes: HtmlToMarkdown and ImageUploader.

HtmlToMarkdown converts html files to markdown files, but HtmlToMarkdown does not know what to do with images.
So it uses a collaborator called ImageUploader. ImageUploader knows how to store images in the cloud.


These classes could be write as follows::

   class HtmlToMarkdown(object):

      def __init__(self, image_uploader):
         self.image_uploader = image_uploader


   class ImageUploader(object):
      pass


To make crc-diagram generate the CRC cards just add docstrings to the classes with these notations::


   class HtmlToMarkdown(object):
      """
      @collaborator: ImageUploader
      @responsibility: Convert html files to markdown
      """
      def __init__(self, image_uploader):
         self.image_uploader = image_uploader


   class ImageUploader(object):
      """
      @responsibility: Store images in the cloud
      """
      pass


* Any of the notations can be ignored, as you can see in ImageUploader.
* You can add more than one collaborator or responsibility.

Save this code as markdown_converter.py and run the following command::

   crc-diagram markdown_converter.py markdown_converter.png --view=true


This command will extract the CRC Cards and render as png. The :code:`--view` option is to open the rendered diagram.

And the result is:

Extracting CRCs from modules
----------------------------

It's also posible to extract CRCs from modules.
The only thing you must do is to add docstrings to a module::

    """
    file: module.py

    @collaborator: A module collaborator
    @responsibility: A module responsibility
    """

----------
Installing
----------

You can get the library directly from PyPI::

   pip install crc-diagram



To render the diagrams you need to install dot:

* Ubuntu/Debian::

   apt-get update && apt-get install graphviz

* Fedora/CentOS::

   yum install graphviz
